Old EZ Wheel Wrapper

  7.04.002 - February 2009
      - Now turning G27 LEDs off instead of on when destroying main
        object.
  7.04.001 - November 2008
      - Upgraded with latest EZ Controller Input Wrapper that fixes
        bug causing centering spring to sometimes stay on when
        multiple wheels are plugged in on startup.
  7.03.001 - October 2008
      - Changed how getting and setting properties is done to make
        it asynchronous. Simplified API. Removed support for
        previous way of doing things (sorry no backwards
        compatibility on this one). Logitech Gaming Software 5.03 or
        newer needs to be installed for this to work.
      - Upgraded with new EZ Controller Input Wrapper that fixes bug
        causing centering spring to sometimes trigger on plug/unplug
        of other USB devices.
  7.02.002 - August 2008
      - Added support for seeing whether shifter is gated or
        sequential. For this feature and the LED feature to work,
        Logitech Gaming Software 5.03 must be installed.
  7.02.001 - July 2008
      - Added support for controlling LEDs on G27
  7.01.002 - June 2008
      - Removed usage of MFC
      - Removed invisible window
      - Made a number of minor improvements to enhance compatibility
        with games and with EZ Wheel Wrappers on other platforms.
      - Updated with latest EZ Controller Input Wrapper to make it
        more solid for when unplugging and plugging in multiple
        devices.
  7.01.001 - May 2008
      - Added functions to get and set wheel properties such as
        steering range, combined/separate pedals, forces strengths,
        etc. For these functions to succeed, Logitech Gaming
        Software version 5.02 or newer needs to be
        installed. Otherwise the functions will simply fail.
  7.00.001 - December 2007
      - Replaced built-in DInput code with EZ Controller Input
        Wrapper.
  6.00.001 - January 2007
      - Re-wrote the wrapper for cleaner and more extensible code.
      - Added built-in hot plug/unplug to make it behave like
        console version.
      - Added extra IsConnected() methods to find out about
        manufacturer and type of device, as well as specific model.
      - Added GetFriendlyProductName() method.
      - Changed parameters to be percentages instead of
        system-specific numbers.
  5.00.003 - September 2006
      - Added HasForceFeedback method.
  5.00.002 - July 2006

      - Made definition names more unique to avoid clashes.
      - Updated SampleInGameImplementation.cpp.
      - Enhanced treatment of quick back to back front or side
        collisions.
